Use web2podcast.pl alongside StremRipper to rip webcasts and turn them into
podcasts.  I use a cronjob to make a podcast of Corsten's Countdown:

56 12 * * 3 streamripper http://www.di.fm/mp3/trance.pls --quiet -s -d /home/din
omite/tmp/streamRips/ -l 7500 -u "MPlayer/2:1.0~rc2-0ubuntu17" && /home/dinomite
/sandbox/subversion/web2podcast/web2podcast.pl "Corsten's Countdown" "Ferry Cors
ten" "Ferry Corsten - Corsten's Countdown"

StreamRipper records an hour on either side of the time Corstens Countdown runs,
so that I don't miss shows when daylight savings changes.  After that is done,
web2podcast.pl comes along and makes a podcast.  On my desktop, iTunes grabs
that, and I listen to it at my leisure.
